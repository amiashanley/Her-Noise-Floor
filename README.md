This project responds to audio materials housed on “Her Noise Hard-Drive” (Archive Item: HN/1/2/1/7) within the “Her Noise Archive” at LCC’s Special Collections Centre. Specifically, the interview segments within five of the six radio programs from Melanie Clifford's Resonance Fm “Her Noise Series”. 

These programs were broadcast at 16.30 - 16.45 GMT throughout November and December 2005, coinciding with the Her Noise exhibition at the South London Gallery. 

The recordings within some of the interview segments, heard in these five programs, contain the presence of an audible noise floor.
